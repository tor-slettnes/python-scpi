/// Each instrument controller command is restricted according to one
/// of four different access levels.  Before executing a given command,
/// the client must obtain the corresponding access level or higher.
/// These levels are:
///
///     GUEST         - commands that can be executed by anyone
///                     (e.g. people connecting via a telnet client over
///                     the internet).
///
///     OBSERVER      - commands that can be used to obtain the
///                     status of the instrument, without interfering
///                     with its operation.
///
///     CONTROLLER    - commands that can be used to control the 
///                     operation of the instrument (e.g. to start
///                     or stop a run).
///
///     ADMINISTRATOR - commands that can be used to modify instrument
///                     settings, e.g. network settings, time/timezone..
///
///     FULL          - commands that can be used to modify instrument
///                     behaviour; e.g. to redefine macros that are integral
///                     and published parts of the instrument framework.
